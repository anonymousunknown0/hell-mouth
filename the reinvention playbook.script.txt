HELL-MOUTH  
INSERT – THE SPIRAL NOTEBOOK: “REINVENTION PLAYBOOK”

INT. BLACK VOID – HUNTER’S DESK – NIGHT

A battered SPIRAL NOTEBOOK lies open under a harsh desk lamp.  
Coffee rings, smudged fingerprints, lipstick stains.  
Pages thick with notes, diagrams, and scribbled timelines.

CLOSE ON:  
PAGE 33 – “THE PLAN TO REINVENT (WITH PUBLICIST)”

SCRAWLED HEADERS, PR PROFESSIONAL HANDWRITING:

    — REINVENTION STRATEGY – DRAFT 7 —
    (Hunter / The Publicist)

LISTED, NUMBERED—EACH A NEW PAGE, A NEW LAYER OF ARMOR:

**1. CRISIS MANAGEMENT**  
    — Inventory threats. List all current and potential scandals.  
    — Draft immediate response: “We are aware / We are investigating / Updates soon.”  
    — Control initial statement—beat tabloids to the punch.

**2. MEDIA GATEKEEPING**  
    — Approve all interview requests.  
    — Pre-interview: rehearse “vulnerable but unbroken.”  
    — Friendly media exclusive—reset the narrative, own the first comeback headline.

**3. NEWS DUMPING**  
    — Bundle all minor slip-ups with bigger news for Friday release.  
    — Aim for background noise. “Let them get lost in the shuffle.”

**4. DISTRACTION & REDIRECTION**  
    — Stage new collab/project launch day after scandal breaks.  
    — Leak rumors of humanitarian effort, orchestrate spontaneous photo op.

**5. REPUTATION LAUNDERING**  
    — Align with trending cause (“mental health,” “youth literacy,” “ocean clean-up”).  
    — Schedule high-visibility award show attendance.  
    — Anonymous donations with strategic leaks to press.

**6. NARRATIVE CONTROL**  
    — Prep talking points for all allies and insiders.  
    — Feed “anonymous” tips to shift blame and focus.  
    — Quietly pitch alternative angles: “growth,” “bravery,” “taking accountability.”

**7. NDA & LEGAL LEVERAGE**  
    — Circulate NDAs to all recent partners, staff, and service providers.  
    — Monitor exes. Activate cease-and-desist protocol as needed.  
    — Preemptively settle with ironclad silence clauses.

**8. SOCIAL MEDIA ORCHESTRATION**  
    — Apology post: handwritten, emotional, minimalist.  
    — Launch fan-driven hashtag campaign (“#HunterHeals,” “#NextChapter”).  
    — Subtle influencer push—meme the comeback.

**9. REPUTATION MONITORING**  
    — Live monitor all trending keywords: “Hunter,” “Scandal,” “Reinvention.”  
    — Deploy rapid-response team for major spikes or leaks.  
    — Update sentiment maps every hour.

**10. REDEMPTION ARC**  
    — Secure first interview with trusted outlet (“safe space,” “full transparency”).  
    — Book a major collaboration—public cosign from untouchable celeb.  
    — Plan “unexpected” emotional moment for viral resonance.

**BONUS: THE SHADOW FIXER MOVES**  
    — Buy up damaging media before it hits market.  
    — Suppress search results.  
    — Quietly settle with silence, never signatures.

INTERCUT –  
HUNTER’S HAND nervously tracing each bullet point.  
A fresh page, half-torn, reads in all caps:

    “THE ONLY STRATEGY THAT MATTERS:  
     STOP CURATING.  
     START LIVING.”

Beneath it, the Publicist’s handwriting:

    “NOT YET.  
     FIRST, WE SURVIVE THE SPIN.”

Hunter’s breath fogs the lamp.  
He closes the notebook, thumb pressed hard on the cover—  
A moment between survival and reinvention.

CUT BACK TO:  
THE VOID.  
The spiral notebook vanishes into darkness.
