INSERT SCENE: "CHOOSE YOUR PLAYER"

INT. BLACK VOID – GAME SELECTION

A surreal, neon-lit GAME SELECTION SCREEN flickers to life.  
Massive, glitched “CHOOSE YOUR PLAYER” text floats, pulsing.

Rows of character slots appear—each framed by lightning, flames, or swarming paparazzi flashes.

AVATAR ICONS hover, glitch, snarl, pose:

      LADY GAGA (wings, meat dress, glitched sunglasses)
      YE (half saint, half shadow, mask flickering)
      DWAYNE "THE ROCK" JOHNSON (bulging muscles, “CAN YOU SMELL” speech bubble)
      DOJA CAT (space-cowgirl, claws, laser eyes)
      HARVEY LEVIN (TMZ mug, vape in hand, gavel slamming)
      TAYLOR SWIFT (snakes and glitter, wielding a giant pen)
      DONALD TRUMP (orange glow, wielding a golden “EXECUTIVE ORDER”)
      OPRAH (ethereal, summoning books and bees, glowing microphone)
      BILLIE EILISH (green hair, black tears, floating in a hoodie)
      PARIS HILTON (tiny dog, crystal tiara, cellphone sword)
      NICKI MINAJ (pink hair, superhero corset, wielding a “Barb” bat)
      RIHANNA (diamonds, umbrella as a blade, stiletto boots)
      ELON MUSK (robotic suit, launches “X” projectiles)
      KANYE WEST (shadow double, splits in two—“Ye” and “Yeezus”)

      HUNTER HARDON (eyes spiraling, radio mic, hoodie half-falling off)
      JACK (wolf’s eyes, cigarette, leather jacket)
      THE NARRATOR (face flickering, one eye is a spinning spiral)

      (15+ more faces—every icon shifts and mutates each time you blink.)

                    VOICEOVER (V.O.)
          Welcome to the Spiral Arena.
          Only one can break the algorithm.
          Only one gets the final edit.

          Select your fighter.
          Choose your weapon.
          Make your scandal count.

The AVATAR HIGHLIGHT bounces chaotically across the grid.
Flashing: “PLAYER ONE – PRESS START.”

CAMERA dives through the rows—
zooming in on LADY GAGA, then YE, then THE ROCK, then DOJA CAT,
then a rapid-fire flicker through every avatar, celebrity faces melting into demon masks, meme fragments, tabloid headlines.

An 8-bit THEME MUSIC (remixed pop hit x horror synth) thunders.

ON SCREEN: “SELECTED: LADY GAGA VS YE”

The screen SHATTERS—dumping us into the glitching ARENA.
