INSERT – FREEZE FRAME – BLACK VOID (YE CALL)

INT. BLACK VOID – TIMELESS

Everything stops. Voices echo in slow motion.

A phone screen glows in the dark:
ON SCREEN: “INCOMING CALL: YE.”

                    NARRATOR (V.O.)
          Pause.
          Understand what’s happening here.

          For Hunter, a phone call from Ye isn’t just gossip or fandom.
          It’s not just a celebrity cameo.
          It’s a signal from the center of the media spiral.

          When Ye calls, it’s like being summoned to Olympus—
          Like Zeus hurling a lightning bolt straight to your battered brain.

          Ye is the code. The rupture.
          The glitch in the American myth.
          He is power, prophecy, controversy—
          and in this world, everybody wants to be close to the power.

          To get a call from Ye means you’ve crossed over—
          From spectator to participant.
          From victim to variable.

                    (closer, almost whispering)
          Ye’s voice in your ear means you matter.
          You’re a threat, or a vessel.
          Or a warning shot fired in 4/4 time.

                    (beat)

          For Hunter? It’s not even about approval.
          It’s about being witnessed by the only eyes
          that really change the algorithm.

          That call?
          It means the spiral just got a new center.

Unfreeze. The phone rings again—louder, cosmic.
