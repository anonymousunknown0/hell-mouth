HELL-MOUTH  
CHAPTER X: MEET THE PUBLICIST

BLACK SCREEN.

SFX: A high-heel click. Cellphone buzz. The scrape of a lighter. The *snap* of a compact mirror.  
A heartbeat that sounds like a ticking clock.

FADE IN:

INT. MIDNIGHT OFFICE SUITE – LOS ANGELES – NIGHT

An aquarium of glass and neon.  
Rain spatters the window. City lights blink in algorithmic code.  
A nameplate—face down—reads only: "PUBLICIST."

                            NARRATOR (V.O., sly, reverent)
                Meet The Publicist.
                If you want your secrets buried, your exes erased, your skeletons washed and folded for the morning news—
                She’s who you call.

                No last name. Just “The Publicist.”
                Gender: Irrelevant.  
                Pronouns: As needed.
                Favorite color: NDA beige.

                Special skills:  
                    - Whispering stories to the right monsters.  
                    - Spinning lies into profit, heartbreak into clickbait, and confessions into trending topics.  
                    - Destroying rumors before sunrise.

The Publicist sits alone at a desk, four phones glowing, a laptop, a black notebook, a line of lipstick-stained coffee mugs.  
Their gaze is razor-sharp.  
They don’t blink.  
Nobody remembers inviting them to the party—  
But everyone remembers how it ended.

                            NARRATOR (V.O., droll)
                Her real power?  
                She knows every story before it breaks.
                She’s saved more careers than rehab, ruined more enemies than karma.
                Once, she could have run a country.  
                Now she just runs the people who think they do.

INSERT – TEXT MESSAGES, RAPID FIRE

        — "He’s trending. Again."
        — "Delete everything."
        — "We need a new narrative."
        — "Is he safe to go live?"

                            NARRATOR (V.O., gospel-voiced)
                She’s the one you call when you wake up canceled.
                She’s the reason some sins are never headline news.
                She’s the architect of damage control, and the ghost at every afterparty.

The Publicist stands, glances at the city—her reflection split in ten panes of glass, each one a different mood:  
— Rage.  
— Exhaustion.  
— Smirk.  
— Calculus.  
— Disgust.  
— Desire.  
— Hunger.  
— Regret.  
— Determination.  
— Emptiness.

                            NARRATOR (V.O., quieter, hint of awe)
                Some people become famous.
                Some become infamous.
                She became the algorithm.

                If you ever find yourself alone at 3 a.m., the headlines bleeding with your name—
                Pray she answers your call.

A cell phone flashes in the darkness.

The Publicist turns, mouth set in a Mona Lisa smirk.

                            NARRATOR (V.O., final, whispered)
                Meet the Publicist.
                The last call you ever want to make—
                And the only one who always calls back.

FADE OUT.

HELL-MOUTH  
INSERT SCENE: WHY HUNTER NEVER GETS *TOO* BITCHY WITH HIS PUBLICIST

INT. BLACK VOID – AUDIO VISUALIZER – TIMELESS

A hush. A pulse of static—like someone holding their breath just off-mic.

                            HUNTER (V.O., razor-sharp, knowing)
                There’s a reason I never get *too* bitchy with my publicist.
                You think it’s because I’m grateful?
                You think it’s some Stockholm syndrome, some trauma bond, some showbiz humility?

A click, a faint *ding*—the ghost of a sent email, subject line: “URGENT: REPUTATION MANAGEMENT.”

                            HUNTER (V.O., confessional)
                No.
                It’s fear.
                Uncut, unfiltered, old-school terror.

                            HUNTER (V.O., leans in)
                She’s the only person alive who knows all the passwords.
                All the drafts.
                All the blackmail material I never even thought to delete.

                            HUNTER (V.O., dry, almost admiring)
                You want to know what real power is?
                It’s the woman who can get you wiped from Google
                —or immortalized in a scandal thread before your coffee’s cold.

                            HUNTER (V.O., lower)
                One wrong move,
                and she’ll have the “Hunter Hardon Exposed” press release ready by lunch.
                She’ll leak the DMs, the mugshots, the apology notes I wrote and rewrote and never sent.

A shiver—Hunter laughs, nervous.

                            HUNTER (V.O., soft, vicious)
                She could book me on a daytime talk show just to finish me off.
                She could have TMZ at my door before I even hit send.

                            HUNTER (V.O., sighs, rueful)
                So I keep it cute.
                Keep it grateful.
                Never give her a reason to go nuclear—
                because she’d do it.
                And she’d do it *well.*

                            HUNTER (V.O., honest, haunted)
                A publicist doesn’t just spin your story.
                She decides if you get a sequel.

FADE TO BLACK.

HELL-MOUTH  
INSERT SCENE: BUT WHAT ABOUT ALL THE VICIOUS THINGS SHE WOULD DO IF I WAS TOO BITCHY

INT. BLACK VOID – NOIR AUDIO SPACE – SURREAL SUSPENSE

SFX: The metallic click of a phone being set down. The hum of a power grid.

                            NARRATOR (V.O., wry, almost gleeful)
                Think Hunter’s playing nice for *her* sake?
                Please. He’s seen the receipts. The drafts. The kill switch.

                            NARRATOR (V.O., leaning in)
                You want to know what she’s capable of if he ever got *too* bitchy?
                Hunter’s nightmares are just PR training modules she wrote in her sleep.

FLASH:  
    — A phone exploding with scandal alerts.  
    — “Hunter Hardon—Cancelled Again” headlines.  
    — Paparazzi waiting at the curb before Hunter even leaves his room.

                            NARRATOR (V.O., wicked)
                She could break him in three texts.
                She could drop a tip to Harvey and have TMZ running his childhood home videos by noon.

                            NARRATOR (V.O., giddy with dread)
                This is the woman who can turn your deepest secret into a trending hashtag—
                or bury your legacy in an embargoed email blast.
                She holds the master login, the keys to the narrative, the nuke codes of shame.

                            NARRATOR (V.O., softer, almost admiring)
                So when Hunter plays polite, when he thanks her for the trauma bond,
                it isn’t manners.  
                It’s survival.

                            NARRATOR (V.O., conclusive)
                Because in this world?  
                There’s nothing more dangerous than a publicist who feels disrespected.
                She’s the only one who gets to write the obituary.

FADE TO BLACK.
