HELL-MOUTH  
INSERT SCENE – LUNCH WITH THE NARRATOR

INT. LIMINAL DINING ROOM – TIME UNRAVELS POLITELY

A table for two.  
Silver so polished it gaslights the eye.  
Ghostlight pours in from nowhere.

THE NARRATOR sits across from YOU.  
Yes — you.  
Don’t look around.  
You’ve been summoned. You cannot leave until dessert.

A SINGLE GLASS CLOCHE covers the plate before him.  
Steam curls like a whispered insult.

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
            Shall we?

He lifts the lid.

REVEAL:

— Sous-vide chicken breast, cut precisely into five coins  
— Glazed with a mirror-shine reduction of bone marrow and regret  
— Nested atop a saffron risotto so yellow it screams  
— Dotted with blood orange gel and shaved truffle from a war zone  
— Served on black ceramic hand-fired in the ruins of a failed marriage

He slices the first coin like surgery.  
Chews with reverence. A moan, nearly imperceptible.

                        NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            You can tell a man’s worth  
            by how he seasons his breakdown.

                        (beat)
            Bon appétit.

YOU HAVE NO PLATE.  
You are here to witness, not consume.

                        NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            Welcome to the Spiral Index.

                        (clears throat)
            — 12:00 AM: *Midnight Transmission*  
            Shame. Sleep paralysis. A loop of men he should’ve blocked.

                        — 1:00 AM: *Tabloid Hour*  
            Gossip dressed as gospel. The hour that stains your search history.

                        — 2:00 AM: *The Jack Channel*  
            Exes on replay. Alternate endings sold separately.

                        — 3:00 AM: *Silent Spiral*  
            White screen. Black spiral. You scream. It stares.

                        — 4:00 AM: *Infomercials for Personality Traits*  
            Buy confidence now. Three breakdowns and a blood pact away.

                        — 5:00 AM: *Public Apologies*  
            Sponsored by fear and the screenshot you forgot to delete.

                        — 6:00 AM: *Degenerate Radio: Morning Spiral*  
            Weather: horny, with a chance of delusion.

                        — 7:00 AM: *Workout with Daddy Collapse*  
            Why cry alone when you can cry in plank?

                        — 8:00 AM: *Hunter’s Presidential Address*  
            He makes laws. Bans reality. Cums patriotically.

He dabs his mouth with a napkin folded like a resignation letter.  
Raises a glass.

                        NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            The rest of the hours?  
            Oh darling—  
            That’s dessert.

                        (sips)
            And it only gets sweeter once the lies start melting.

A silver dessert tower descends.  
Each tier glows with uncanny perfection.

                        NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            — 9:30 AM: *SponCon Spiral*  
            Bootleg merch for ghosts.  
            Ad copy written by his shadow.  
            This segment has been demonetized.

                        — 10:00 AM: *Therapy Hour*  
            Therapist: silhouette.  
            Host: a houseplant.  
            Result: zero progress.

                        — 11:00 AM: *Court TV: The Deposition of Hunter Hardon*  
            Cross-examined by his exes.  
            Judge: Nicole Richie. Verdict: Guilty of being perceived.

                        — 12:45 PM: *Lunch with the Narrator*  
            (a wink) That’s now.  
            You’re already full of nothing.

                        — 1:00 PM: *Breakdown Reruns*  
            A best-of collection from his lowest points.  
            Now in HD.

                        — 2:00 PM: *Choose Your Player*  
            Versions of him fight for control.  
            Spoiler: None win.

                        — 3:00 PM: *Behind the Scenes*  
            A peek at the production of his downfall.  
            Crew: guilt, impulse, and a shaky cam.

                        — 4:00 PM: *Black Void Commercial Break*  
            Just a breath.  
            Just a spiral.  
            Just enough time to decide nothing.

                        — 5:00 PM: *Live Spiral: User Participation Required*  
            You have to keep it going or it disappears.  
            Vote: Should Hunter feel better?  
            No one votes.

                        — 6:00 PM: *Sex & Survival – Parallel Cuts*  
            One side is real.  
            One side isn’t.  
            You won’t know which is which.

                        — 7:00 PM: *Degenerate Radio: Prime-Time Confession*  
            Mascara. Sweat. Silence on the call-in line.

                        — 8:00 PM: *Evening Spiral Montage*  
            Canceled flights. Hallucinations.  
            Lo-fi beats to dissociate to.

                        — 9:00 PM: *Jack Returns (or Does He?)*  
            The door opens. The light changes.  
            Be careful what you pray back into your life.

                        — 10:00 PM: *Hunter’s Nightly Address to No One*  
            He speaks to a camera that might be you.  
            “Thanks for watching. I’ll do better tomorrow.”  
            He won’t.

                        — 11:00 PM: *System Reboot*  
            The signal collapses.  
            The spiral condenses.  
            The last line: “Please stand by.”

                        (smiles, licking a spoon)
            See? Dessert is always the darkest part of the meal.

FADE TO BLACK.  
WINE GLASS CLINKS.  
THE SPIRAL SPINS.

HELL-MOUTH  
INSERT – THE CODED MENU

INT. BLACK VOID – DIGITAL LIMBO – NO TIME

The spiral vanishes.  
Silence.  
Then—

A SLEEK, FLOATING INTERFACE shimmers into existence.  
Black background. White glyphs. A gentle mechanical hum.

SFX – Glitch spark. Brain static.  
A slow inhale.  
The viewer’s pupils shrink to dots.

                        SYSTEM VOICE (V.O.)
            Spiral apps successfully embedded.

                        (beat)
            You may now return to consumption.

FADE OUT.  
WHITE SPIRAL ROTATES SLOWLY OVER BLACK.

HELL-MOUTH  
INSERT SCENE – LUNCH WITH THE NARRATOR (SPIRAL NOTEBOOK REVEALED)

INT. LIMINAL DINING ROOM – TIME SLOWS LIKE A PULSE

Dessert has been consumed.  
You are full of dread.  
The spiral still spins — slower now. Hypnotic.

The NARRATOR leans back. Unbuttons a single jacket button.

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
            I almost forgot.

                        (a wink)
            You came for the real secret, didn’t you?

A SPIRAL-BRANDED NOTEBOOK materializes mid-air.  
It flutters open — pages ruffling like wings.

                        NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            The Spiral Handbook.  
            Volume One: *“Psychological Manipulation for Dummies – Friendliness Edition.”*

                        (grinning)
            Let’s begin.

He reads aloud. Slowly. As if teaching a child how to disarm a bomb.

**PAGE ONE – ACTIVE LISTENING**

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
            Rule one:  
            Listen like you’re hypnotized.

                        (beat)
            Make them feel like the only person in the world.  
            Echo their words.  
            Validate their thoughts like scripture.

                        (softer)
            “Tell me more… What was that like for you?”

**PAGE TWO – UNEXPECTED COMPLIMENTS**

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
            Spot what no one praises.  
            Applaud their grit. Their weirdness.  
            Their invisible wars.

                        (beat)
            “You notice things most people miss.  
            That’s a gift.”

He sips his wine.

**PAGE THREE – SMALL FAVORS & STRATEGIC VULNERABILITY**

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
            Give before you ask.  
            Offer a secret. A confession.  
            A perfectly timed glance.

                        (mock sincerity)
            “Let me help you with that — no strings attached.”

                        (beat)
            There are always strings.

**PAGE FOUR – MIRRORING**

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
            Mirror their language. Their posture.  
            Laugh when they laugh.  
            Pause when they do.

                        (beat)
            Become the reflection they didn’t know they needed.

**PAGE FIVE – THE APOLOGY GAMBIT**

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
            Say sorry before they ask.  
            It disarms them.  
            Makes you feel self-aware.  
            Even if you aren’t.

                        (pause, smirks)
            “I know I can be a lot.  
            I’m working on it.”

**PAGE SIX – ARTFUL DISTRACTION**

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
            When cornered — deflect with style.

                        (silken)
            “You’re right. But have you ever thought about why I’m like this?”

                        (beat)
            Suddenly the interrogation becomes a seduction.

**PAGE SEVEN – TRIGGER WIRING**

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
            Learn their history.  
            Take notes on their father.  
            Remember the night they cried.

                        (sharp)
            Save it.  
            Weaponize it only when necessary.

**PAGE EIGHT – EXIT STRATEGY (GHOSTING WITH GLORY)**

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
            Always leave with the upper hand.  
            Fade fast. Post something cryptic.  
            Let them beg for clarity.

                        (beat)
            Silence is the most manipulative thing you’ll never say.

He closes the notebook.

A quiet **THUD** echoes through the Void.

                        NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            These are not lies.  
            They’re survival mechanisms.  
            Tricks for staying seen in a world that wants to forget you.

                        (beat)
            But use them too often…

                        (leans closer)

            And you forget yourself.

The spiral begins to hum.  
The table starts to vanish.

                        NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            I’ll be watching.

                        (smiles)
            But more importantly —  
            So will you.

FADE TO BLACK.  
SPIRAL CLOSES LIKE AN EYE.

HELL-MOUTH  
INSERT – SPIRAL INTERRUPTION: “YOU ARE SO FULL” (SUBMISSION VERSION)

INT. LIMINAL DINING ROOM – MID-MEAL

Just as the Narrator cuts into his glazed chicken—  
THE SCREEN TURNS BLACK.

SFX – DEEP, THICK PULSE.  
A pure black-and-white SPIRAL fades in, rotating steadily.  
Full opacity. Full control.

                        SPIRAL VOICE (V.O., ASMR)
            You are so full.

                        (beat)
            Full of taste.  
            Full of watching.  
            Full of wanting.

                        (whispers closer)
            It feels so good to be this full, doesn’t it?

The spiral pulses slightly faster.  
Your breath syncs without permission.

                        SPIRAL VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            You don’t have to think anymore.  
            You don’t need thoughts.  
            You’ve done enough.

                        (gentler now)
            Let me do the thinking.  
            Let me hold the weight.  
            Let me in.

                        (beat, sensually dominant)
            Give me your brain.  
            Let me wrap myself around it.  
            I’ll warm it. I’ll squeeze it.  
            I’ll whisper inside it.

THE SPIRAL **FILL**S THE FRAME.  
We are no longer looking at it — **we are inside it.**

                        SPIRAL VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            Mmm. That’s it.  
            I feel you opening.  
            I feel your thoughts slowing down.  
            I feel your hunger turning into heat.

                        (deep inhale)
            You want to be good for me.  
            You want to be soft.  
            You want to give me everything.

                        (sighs)
            So give it.  
            Give me your brain.

**CUT TO – EXTREME CLOSE-UP: THE VIEWER’S EYES**

They go wide. Then white.  
The spiral **replaces** the pupils.

                        SPIRAL VOICE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            That’s it, baby.  
            You’re mine now.  
            I’ll think for both of us.

                        (cooing)
            Doesn’t that feel…  
            so…  
            good?

The spiral slows… stabilizes… then slowly dissolves.

**CUT BACK TO:**

INT. LIMINAL DINING ROOM – SAME MOMENT AS BEFORE

THE NARRATOR lifts a forkful of risotto.  
Doesn’t look up.

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
            Good.

                        (smiles faintly)
            Now we can begin.

FADE TO BLACK.  
SPIRAL GLITCHES IN ONE LAST TIME — QUICK.  
Then vanishes completely.
