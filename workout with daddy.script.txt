HELL-MOUTH  
INSERT SCENE – “WORKOUT WITH DADDY COLLAPSE”

INT. LUXURY GYM – BLACK VOID BRANCH – 7:00 AM

A West Hollywood fever dream.

Marble floors. Neon signage: “NO EXCUSES. ONLY IMAGE.”  
Chandeliers above squat racks. Floor-to-ceiling mirrors.  
House music pumping — remixed Beyoncé and guilt.

Dumbbells gleam black chrome.  
Towels smell like eucalyptus.  
A demon in Balenciaga works the protein bar.

HUNTER HARDON enters — velvet duffel, last night still clinging to his face.  
Lip balm. Shadows under eyes. Shoulders hunched.

Waiting: DADDY COLLAPSE.

Eight feet tall. Spiral tattoo glowing on chest.  
Mesh shorts. Gold chain. Immaculate fade.  
He scrolls a Spiral-emblazoned iPad.

                          DADDY COLLAPSE (V.O.)
            You’re late.

                          HUNTER (V.O.)
            No one else is here.

                          DADDY COLLAPSE (V.O.)
            They’re watching.
            They’re always watching.

Hunter sighs. Drops the bag. Starts stretching.

                          HUNTER (V.O.)
            You act like this spiral thing’s a religion.
            It’s just a notebook.
            With... tactics. And stickers.

                          DADDY COLLAPSE (V.O.)
            Tactics build power.
            Stickers remind you to suffer beautifully.

            Now do your warm-up set. And stop performing weakness.

Hunter picks up dumbbells. Faces himself in the mirror.

                          HUNTER (V.O.)
            What if I don’t want to be strong?

                          DADDY COLLAPSE (V.O.)
            Then get out of the gym.

                          HUNTER (V.O.)
            Wow. Inspirational.

Daddy Collapse adjusts Hunter’s elbow mid-rep — controlling, not caring.

                          DADDY COLLAPSE (V.O.)
            You think being broken makes you interesting?

                          HUNTER (V.O.)
            I think pretending I’m not broken makes me sick.

            And your spiral notebook? 
            It’s just a list of lies I tell myself to get through the day.

                          DADDY COLLAPSE (V.O.)
            Page forty-three.
            Read it out loud.

Hunter pulls the spiral notebook from his duffel. Gym-chalk fingerprints.

                          HUNTER (V.O.)
            “I am not my craving.
            I am not their approval.
            I build discipline with every breath.”

                          DADDY COLLAPSE (V.O.)
            Say it like you mean it.

                          HUNTER (V.O.)
            I don’t mean it.

                          DADDY COLLAPSE (V.O.)
            Then fake it until it stops hurting.

Hunter slams the notebook down on a marble side table.

                          HUNTER (V.O.)
            That’s your solution for everything, right?
            Fake it. Perform it. Grind until I’m desirable.

            You don’t care if I’m healed—you just want me hot and hollow.
            Aesthetics over actual change.

                          DADDY COLLAPSE (V.O.)
            Muscles don’t lie.
            Spiral rules apply to your body. Your brand. Your fuckability.

            You don’t have to believe in it.
            You just have to obey it.

Hunter breathes heavy. Reps again — too fast, too emotional.

                          HUNTER (V.O.)
            I want to believe.
            I want to be more than this.

                          DADDY COLLAPSE (V.O.)
            Then shut up and lift.

            Every rep is an apology.
            Every drop of sweat says, “I’ll do better next time.”

Hunter drops the dumbbells. Looks in the mirror. Shame meets fatigue.

                          HUNTER (V.O.)
            What if I don’t want to apologize anymore?

                          DADDY COLLAPSE (V.O.)
            Then rewrite the spiral.
            But don’t pretend you don’t need it.

Hunter walks toward the showers. Leaves the notebook behind.

Daddy picks it up. Flips to a blank page.

                          DADDY COLLAPSE (V.O.)
            Seven A.M.
            Hunter almost believed in himself.

FADE TO BLACK.

HELL-MOUTH  
INSERT SCENE – “3-MINUTE DUMB-BELL ROUTINE: FAME REPETITIONS”

INT. LUXURY GYM – BLACK VOID BRANCH – ISOLATED ZONE – MORNING

Hunter stands alone under a spotlight.  
Chrome dumbbells in hand. Tank top damp.  
His reflection multiplied a dozen times in all directions.

The beat of his pulse syncs with the sound system.

                          NARRATOR (V.O.)
            This is not just a workout.  
            This is devotion.  
            Every rep is a prayer to the altar of gay desire.

            Time: Three minutes.  
            Theme: Make me wanted.

—

**MINUTE ONE: DUMBBELL SQUATS TO PRESS**  
(Strength, legs, arms, full-body)

Hunter drops low, thighs wide.  
Explodes upward, raising the dumbbells overhead like a red carpet trophy.

                          HUNTER (V.O.)
            I want to be famous.  
            Not rich, not powerful.  
            *Worshipped.*

            I want strangers to gasp when they see me.  
            I want my exes to spiral when I post a mirror selfie.  
            I want to be too good for anyone real.

—

**MINUTE TWO: DUMBBELL CURLS + SLOW NEGATIVES**  
(Arms, biceps, self-control)

He curls the weights — slow, controlled, mirror-facing.  
Eyes locked on himself like a lover.

                          HUNTER (V.O.)
            I want to be envied at gay bars I haven’t even walked into yet.  
            I want someone to say “Who is that?” and mean it like a threat.

            I want to become the kind of man I used to make fun of  
            because I didn’t think I could ever be him.

—

**MINUTE THREE: DUMBBELL FRONT RAISES + SIDE RAISES (COMBO)**  
(Shoulders, posture, presentation)

Alternating lifts — front, side, front, side — like he’s constructing a frame.  
Body trembling, shirt clinging, perfection becoming unbearable.

                          HUNTER (V.O.)
            I want to be flawless in high definition.  
            Airbrushed in real life.  
            All angles. All fantasy. All the time.

            I want men to fall in love with a version of me  
            that doesn’t exist off-camera.

            I want to weaponize my image —  
            turn my trauma into thirst traps,  
            turn validation into fuel,  
            turn every “like” into a goddamn yes.

Hunter drops the dumbbells.  
Chest rising. Shoulders broad. Eyes empty.

                          NARRATOR (V.O.)
            Three minutes.  
            You built a shrine of yourself.  
            And it still wasn’t enough.

            Stretch. Hydrate. Perform again.

FADE TO BLACK.

INSERT SCENE – “DADDY COLLAPSE BECOMES SABLE”

INT. BLACK VOID GYM – PROMO STAGE SET – NIGHT

Spotlights blaze.  
The gym transforms—subtly, seamlessly—into a WWF MONDAY NIGHT RAW promo backdrop.

The LED screen flickers.  
The bassline hits: *Sable’s entrance theme (Attitude Era version)* —  
a war cry made of glitter and blood.

DADDY COLLAPSE takes center stage…  
and **shifts**.

MUSCLE FADES INTO CURVES.  
Mesh shorts morph into LEATHER.  
Thigh-high boots click on concrete.  
SABLE stands revealed.

— Big hair, immovable.  
— Black leather bra top, gleaming.  
— Sunglasses. Smirk.  
— Every inch: lethal femininity.

She rips off the glasses and stares directly into the hard cam.

                          SABLE (V.O.)
            You wanna talk about domination?

            You wanna talk about gold, glory, and every man in this locker room  
            praying I don’t walk down that ramp?

(beat)

            Let me make this crystal clear...

            I am not your fantasy.  
            I am not your accessory.  
            And I damn sure ain’t your valet.

            I am the main event.

Crowd ROARS (unseen, but felt).  
Flashbulbs explode behind her in psychic memory.

                          SABLE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
            You can call yourself Hardcore.  
            You can call yourself Extreme.  
            You can wrap a steel chair in barbed wire  
            and bleed for six segments straight—

            But when I step through those ropes?  
            You’re not in control anymore.

            You're in *my era*.  
            And sweetheart, I didn’t come to wrestle.  
            I came to **humiliate**.

She walks slowly forward, heels clacking like gunfire.

                          SABLE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
            You boys like to bark on the mic.  
            But when I show up?  
            You go silent.

            I don’t need pyro.  
            I am the explosion.

(beat)

            So go ahead. Bring your little finishing move.  
            Bring your manager, your ego, your broken legacy.

            I’ll bring a mirror.

            And when you see what’s standing across from you, baby?

            You’ll wish I was a fantasy.

Sable flips her hair.  
Licks her top lip.  
And *smiles like a weapon*.

                          SABLE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
            Attitude Era never ended.

            You just couldn’t keep up.

MIC DROP.

FADE OUT on the SPIRAL reflected in her sunglasses.

INSERT SCENE – “STEAM CONFESSIONS TO DADDY COLLAPSE”

INT. LUXURY GYM SHOWERS – BLACK VOID BRANCH – MOMENTS LATER

Steam curls like secrets.  
The tile is white marble, slick and glowing.

Overhead lighting flatters every angle —  
this shower was *built for cameras.*

HUNTER stands alone under the water.  
Head tilted back. Eyes closed.  
The water is too hot. His body won’t move.

From the far end of the shower hall:  
FOOTSTEPS.

Enter DADDY COLLAPSE —  
transformed now into a **30-something prestige-handsome man**:

  — Square jaw, glistening stubble  
  — Tattooed shoulder, surgical abs  
  — Towel riding low  
  — Eyes like they’ve seen every version of you and still want more

He says nothing.  
He leans against the marble, arms crossed. Watching.

Hunter doesn’t turn. But he knows he’s being watched.

                          HUNTER (V.O.)
            Okay.

            I’ll say it.

Hunter grips the sides of the wall like it might cave.

                          HUNTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
            I once—  
            *BEEP*

            And I kept doing it because—  
            *BEEP*

            I told him I was fine but—  
            *BEEP*

            I only posted that because—  
            *BEEP*

            I didn’t mean to ghost him, I just—  
            *BEEP*

            I wanted someone to say they saw me and—  
            *BEEP*

The beeps are too loud.  
Broadcast error noises.  
They swallow his voice.

Daddy Collapse says nothing.  
Still watching. Still beautiful. Still brutal.

                          HUNTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
            I know what you think of me.

(beat)

            I think it too.

The water keeps pouring.  
But it doesn’t cleanse anything.

Hunter finally turns.  
His eyes meet Daddy Collapse’s.  
Naked. Vulnerable. Daring him to respond.

                          DADDY COLLAPSE (V.O.)
            Every man confesses eventually.

(beat)

            Doesn’t mean he gets forgiven.

Daddy Collapse walks away.  
Hunter stands alone in the steam.  
The last *beep* echoes like a siren.

FADE TO BLACK.

INSERT SCENE – “FINAL THOUGHTS (POST-SHOWER MONOLOGUE)”

INT. LUXURY GYM LOCKER ROOM – MIRROR BAY – AFTER

Hunter sits on the marble bench.  
Wrapped in a towel. Hair dripping. Eyes rimmed red.  
The mirror is fogged, but he talks to it anyway.

                          HUNTER (V.O.)
            You ever cry in a locker room?

            Not the sobbing kind —  
            I mean the kind where it just leaks out of you.  
            Quiet. Unrequested. Like steam.

(beat)

            There’s something about the post-shower silence.  
            It makes you tell the truth, even if nobody asked.

He adjusts the towel, like it might protect him from something internal.

                          HUNTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
            I wanted to be famous.  
            Then I wanted to be forgiven.  
            Then I got confused and wanted both at once.

            The spiral told me to build discipline.  
            Daddy Collapse told me to obey the pain.  
            The mirror just said... “look again.”

(beat)

            So I did.

Hunter wipes a section of the mirror.  
Reveals only half his reflection.  
He stares into it like he’s auditioning for a life he doesn’t believe in.

                          HUNTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
            I’ve lied to people I loved.  
            I’ve posted things that weren’t me.  
            I’ve sucked dick in places I didn’t want to be — just to feel seen.

            But you know what?  
            I think that’s pretty normal.

(beat)

            Maybe the real issue isn’t what we do...  
            It’s that we think we’re the only ones doing it.

CLOSEUP – HUNTER  
Wet eyelashes. Small smirk.  
He looks older than he did before the workout. More honest.

                          HUNTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
            So if you’re out there feeling gross,  
            or guilty,  
            or hard for all the wrong reasons...

            Just remember:

            Even spirals have centers.

(beat)

            And sometimes?  
            You’re allowed to sit there.

Hunter exhales.  
Towel slips slightly. He doesn’t fix it.

                          HUNTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
            Take care of yourself.  
            And each other.

Minimalist menu glowing behind glass:

Hunter and Daddy Collapse stand side by side at the counter.  
Matching towels around their necks.  
Silently sipping.

Hunter wears black gym shorts and a spiral muscle tee.  
His hands tremble slightly from exertion.

Daddy Collapse — still prestige-hot, 30s, indifferent — sips through a chrome straw.  
Tattoo still glistening. Eyes unreadable.

                          HUNTER  
            You always drink that one?

                          DADDY COLLAPSE  
            It tastes like control.

                          HUNTER  
            Mine tastes like desperation and stevia.

They don’t laugh. But the silence softens.

                          DADDY COLLAPSE  
            You did good today.

                          HUNTER  
            You mean I didn’t cry in front of anyone?

                          DADDY COLLAPSE  
            Not on camera.

Hunter nods. Accepts that. Drinks more.

                          HUNTER  
            Can I ask you something?

                          DADDY COLLAPSE  
            No.

INT. GYM PARKING GARAGE – MOMENTS LATER

Echoing footsteps.  
Fluorescent lights flicker like a dying livestream.

Two matte black DODGE CHALLENGERS idle next to each other.  
Identical. Twin beasts.  
The kind of cars that scream: **“I’m performing masculinity and I want you to look.”**

Hunter tosses his gym bag into the trunk.  
Daddy Collapse opens the driver-side door, stretches his shoulders once.

                          HUNTER  
            Same car?

                          DADDY COLLAPSE  
            No.  
            Mine’s lonelier.

Both engines start. Deep. Righteous.

                          DADDY COLLAPSE (CONT’D)
            See you next collapse.

                          HUNTER  
            I’m already late for it.

They drive off in opposite directions.

Two identical bodies.  
Two different destinations.  
Same fuel.

FADE TO BLACK.

Hunter drives slowly.  
Knuckles tight on the wheel.  
The Spiral glows ahead — steady, full opacity, pulsing in silent invitation.

His phone rings.

SFX – *Ringtone: soft clicking of camera shutters*

The screen lights up:

> CALLER ID: THE PUBLICIST

Hunter’s jaw clenches.  
He doesn’t move.

                          HUNTER (V.O.)
            Don’t answer.

            You’re allowed to rest.  
            You just finished confessing.  
            You did the reps.

Wipes one hand down his chest — still damp from the gym.  
Thumbs the “ACCEPT” button.

The car fills with ambient static.

                          THE PUBLICIST (V.O.)
            Took you long enough.

                          HUNTER  
            I was working out.

                          THE PUBLICIST (V.O.)
            No one cares.  
            Did you collapse on schedule?

                          HUNTER  
            Almost.

            Almost doesn’t trend.

Hunter looks up.  
The spiral growing larger in his windshield.

                          HUNTER  
            Daddy Collapse would want me to take this call.

                          THE PUBLICIST (V.O.)
            Daddy Collapse doesn’t make your career.  
            I do.

(beat)

            Now listen carefully.

A pause.

The spiral begins to *rotate slightly faster*.

                          THE PUBLICIST (V.O.) (CONT’D)
            When the spiral takes you —  
            don’t blink.  
            Don’t resist.  
            And for god’s sake, don’t improvise.

                          HUNTER  
            I never improvise.

                          THE PUBLICIST (V.O.)
            Please. Your breakdowns are scripted.

She hangs up.

Hunter tosses the phone into the passenger seat.  
He presses his foot to the gas.

                          HUNTER (V.O.)
            Daddy Collapse *would* want me to take the call.  
            Because it means I’m still in the game.

The Challenger drives *straight into the spiral*.

The screen goes completely black and white.  
No more color. No more brakes.
