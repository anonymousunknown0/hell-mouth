// HELL-MOUTH
// CHAPTER X: PRESIDENTIAL PRESS CONFERENCE – THE CONFESSION (SELECTIVELY CENSORED)

INT. GRAND PRESS HALL – NIGHT

TV LIGHTS blaze.  
A cavernous hall, heavy with history and threat.

Hundreds of REPORTERS fill the aisles—flashes explode, eyes hungry.

A lone presidential podium under a pitiless SPOTLIGHT.  
Two flags flank the stage:  
    — One AMERICAN.  
    — One SPIRAL, black on white—symbol of the unspeakable.

HUNTER HARDON, 33, enters.  
Every step measured. Suit immaculate, skin waxy beneath the lights.  
He stands at the podium, hands gripping its edges.

                        HUNTER
            (into microphone, trembling)
        Thank you for coming.  
        I know why you’re all here.

A shiver passes through the crowd.  
CAMERA LENSES thrust forward.  
ON SCREEN:  
Live news ticker bleeds—“BREAKING: HUNTER HARDON TO ADDRESS ALLEGATIONS.”

                        HUNTER (CONT’D)
            (measured, voice rough with truth)
        I have spent my life performing—for you, for them, for myself.  
        I have chased fame, attention, applause—until none of it meant anything.  
        I have also spent my life running from something darker.

Uneasy murmur.  
Some reporters lower their phones.  
A moment of breathless tension.

                        HUNTER (CONT’D)
            (bracing himself)
        Tonight, I am not running.  
        I am here to say the thing I have always feared would destroy me.  
        Years ago, I was *BEEP* for promoting sexual material involving a minor.  
        I go to *BEEP* every week.  
        For ten years, I have carried this.  
        There are no excuses.  
        I am not here for forgiveness.  
        I am here for truth.

Shock ripples through the hall—some gasp, some recoil, some lean forward.  
FLASHBULBS strobe, rapid as machine gun fire.

                        HUNTER (CONT’D)
            (raw)
        I live with mental illness.  
        There were voices—thoughts that didn’t belong to me, urges I couldn’t explain.  
        That is not a shield.  
        It is the terrain I walk every day.

His hands tremble, knuckles white on the podium.

                        HUNTER (CONT’D)
            (voice breaking, eyes shining)
        I am not proud.  
        I am not the victim.  
        But I am not only what I did.  
        I have spent every day since trying to be someone better—someone safer for the world, and for myself.

Hunter looks up—straight into the CAMERA, as if facing the world.

                        HUNTER (CONT’D)
            (fierce, defiant)
        If you must judge me, judge all of me.  
        My story is not an excuse.  
        But I refuse to disappear in shame.  
        If there is any hope left in this world, it is in saying the unsayable,  
        in holding our monsters to the light,  
        and believing that some kind of healing is possible—even for people like me.

The room holds its breath, the moment stretched thin as wire.

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
            (solemn, mythic—echoes in the black)
        History is a graveyard of confessions and denials.  
        Tonight, a man named Hunter Hardon stood in the ruins of his life  
        and dared the world to look back.

Hunter steps back from the podium, shaking—chest heaving, eyes wet but unbroken.

                        HUNTER
            (voice cracked, growing steady)
        If you know the worst of me—  
        Then you must also know the best in me.

He wipes his eyes.  
Scans the crowd—hatred, fear, curiosity, and something like faith.

                        HUNTER (CONT’D)
            (determined)
        I am not only my lowest moment.  
        I am not just my shame.  
        I am also everything I have built from the rubble.

Hunter’s voice lifts—press, public, world listening.

                        HUNTER (CONT’D)
        I have seen how easy it is to destroy a life,  
        to cancel a person, to erase someone’s future.  
        I have also seen—through pain and hard work—  
        how possible it is to rebuild,  
        to change,  
        to fight for something bigger than yourself.

A beat. Hunter finds his center, hands steady.

                        HUNTER (CONT’D)
            (bold, almost preaching)
        If you want to know what I believe—  
        I believe in new laws.  
        Laws that protect our queer youth, our trans youth, our lost and our loud.  
        I believe in a world where gay rights and gender rights are human rights.  
        I believe in a future where “world gay peace” is not a joke,  
        but a mission.

The crowd shifts—disbelief, resistance, but also tears and nods.

                        HUNTER (CONT’D)
        I want a world where healing is possible.  
        Where no one is defined by their worst act forever.  
        Where accountability and compassion are not enemies,  
        but partners.

                        HUNTER (CONT’D)
        I want policies that fund recovery, not just punishment.  
        That give second chances—not just sentences.  
        I want schools to teach kids they are loved—no matter how they love.  
        I want every closet door torn off its hinges.

                        HUNTER (CONT’D)
        I want queer elders on every city council,  
        drag queens on every school board,  
        and a rainbow in every courthouse.

                        HUNTER (CONT’D)
            (voice breaking with hope)
        I want world gay peace—starting now.

He smiles—awkward, trembling, but luminous.

                        HUNTER (FINAL)
            (soft)
        If you must remember me, remember this:  
        There is no healing in shame.  
        Only in truth,  
        in love,  
        and in a world that believes people can change.

A hush—hope and outrage, disbelief and inspiration mix in the air.  
The spiral flag seems to shimmer, almost alive.

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
            (quietly amazed, mythic)
        From the spiral, he cast a wish.  
        Not for forgiveness, but for revolution.

Hunter stands tall, for once unafraid, and steps away—then returns to the podium.

                        HUNTER
            (commanding, with conviction)
        I will not leave you only with my failures.  
        If you have come here for a spectacle, let it be one of hope.

He holds up a sheet of paper—five laws, bold and unyielding.

                        HUNTER (CONT’D)
        Here are five new laws this country—and this world—needs, now:

He reads, each word lands like a gavel.

                        HUNTER (READING ALOUD)
        Law One:  
        Universal Queer & Trans Protections.  
        No one—child, teen, or adult—may be discriminated against in housing, education, work, or healthcare based on sexuality, gender identity, or gender expression.  
        Violators will answer to the full force of the law.

                        HUNTER (CONT’D)
        Law Two:  
        Restorative Justice for All.  
        Sentencing for nonviolent crimes, especially those rooted in addiction, mental illness, or poverty, must prioritize treatment, recovery, and reconciliation over punishment.  
        Every prison must offer real paths to re-entry, healing, and dignity.

                        HUNTER (CONT’D)
        Law Three:  
        Gay & Gender-Affirming Curriculum in Schools.  
        Every public school will teach LGBTQ+ history, culture, and respect—from kindergarten through high school.  
        No more erasure. Every kid will see themselves in the story.

                        HUNTER (CONT’D)
        Law Four:  
        National Ban on Conversion Therapy and Anti-Trans Legislation.  
        Any practice, policy, or law that tries to “cure” queerness or block gender-affirming care is abolished—effective immediately.  
        Survivors receive reparations and free counseling, for life.

                        HUNTER (CONT’D)
        Law Five:  
        World Gay Peace Accords.  
        The United States will lead an international coalition, vowing to protect LGBTQ+ rights everywhere—offering asylum to any queer or trans person under threat, and funding safe havens worldwide.

Hunter lowers the paper. The press room is silent, stunned.

                        HUNTER (FINAL, PROUD)
        These laws are not radical.  
        They are overdue.  
        If my story has any value left—let it be the spark for a world that doesn’t eat its outcasts alive,  
        but makes them heroes.

He steps back, tears shining—unashamed, unbowed.

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
            (quietly triumphant, mythic)
        He stood naked before the world—  
        not for mercy,  
        but for revolution.

Hunter walks away from the podium.  
The spiral flag trembles, then breaks—light pouring through the crack.

For a moment, the world is new.

— CUT TO: —

INT. GRAND PRESS HALL – CONTINUOUS

Hunter stands at the podium—confession hanging in the air.  
For a split second, time freezes.

Suddenly—a wall of SOUND.  
Shouts, camera shutters, click-clack of a thousand texts.  
Reporters leap to their feet, hands shooting up.

                        REPORTER #1 (shouting)
        Is this an admission of guilt?

                        REPORTER #2 (yelling)
        Do you think you deserve forgiveness? What do you say to the victims?

A protester stands, screaming:

                        PROTESTER
        MONSTER! Get off the stage!

A woman sobs openly in the front row.  
A security guard edges closer, hand on radio.  
TV feeds cut between close-ups—Hunter’s trembling face, outraged crowd, tweets flooding screens:  
#HunterHardonCancelled #NoForgiveness

                        HUNTER
            (into chaos, barely audible)
        I told you the truth.  
        I told you everything I could.

A cup is thrown—security intercepts.  
A man in the balcony shouts:

                        BALCONY MAN
        THIS IS HOLLYWOOD! THIS IS AMERICA!

Hunter’s breath hitches.  
The crowd blurs—faces melting, multiplying, hungry for shame.

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
            (low, edged with awe and pity)
        When you speak the unspeakable, the world howls for blood.  
        The wound becomes a spectacle.

Hunter staggers back from the podium as security forms a wall.  
The spiral flag flickers—almost writhing in the TV lights.

FADE OUT.
