INSERT SCENE: MEET YE

BLACK.

                SFX: DIGITAL ORGAN. SYNTHESIZED CHOIR.  
                SFX: SNAPSHOTS, STADIUM RUMBLE.

A white sneaker stamps into the void—leaves an imprint.

                NARRATOR (V.O.)
        You want genius?
        You want controversy in human form?
        Meet Ye.

            (beat)

        Formerly known as Kanye Omari West.

THE VOID BLOOMS INTO A GLORIFIED YE MONTAGE—VIDEO, IMAGES, TABLOID HEADLINES:

    — YE as a kid, home video, tapping at a toy piano.
    — YE in the studio, gold chain swinging, conducting chaos, stacks of beat pads and samples.
    — LIFE OF PABLO TOUR: Ye floating over the crowd, stage lit like an alien ship.
    — KUWTK: Ye in the background, silent, sunglasses reflecting TV static.
    — VMAs: Ye interrupts Taylor Swift, snatches mic, censors himself mid-rant.
    — Paparazzi flashbulbs: Ye grinning, Ye shouting, Ye dead-eyed and hooded in Paris.
    — YE in the Oval Office, red hat, ranting, hugs Trump, the internet explodes.
    — “FAMOUS” VIDEO: Naked wax bodies, Ye and a room of “icons.”
    — FASHION WEEK: Ye stomps in Yeezys, surrounded by clones in beige.
    — TWITTER: Threads of rants, deleted tweets, conspiracy charts.

                NARRATOR (V.O., counting off)
        Thirty-two Grammys.  
        College Dropout.  
        Graduation.  
        808s & Heartbreak.  
        My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.  
        Yeezus.  
        The Life of Pablo.  
        Ye.  
        Donda.

            (with reverence and a wink)

        Rapper. Producer. Visionary.  
        Fashion disruptor. Sneaker king.  
        The only man to make a red hat radioactive.

            (quickfire montage)

        Billionaire. Bankrupt. Messiah. Meme.  
        Presidential candidate. Scapegoat.  
        The villain of a thousand think pieces,  
        the hero of his own myth.

CLOSE ON: YE’S EYES—restless, hunted, defiant.

                NARRATOR (V.O.)
        Some call him a genius.  
        Some call him a joke.  
        He calls himself Ye.

            (soft, confessional)

        The world tried to cancel him—he kept remixing the world.

            (a hush, electric)

        You want to know what God sounds like?  
        Sometimes it’s a beat.  
        Sometimes it’s a breakdown on live TV.

    — CLIP: Ye in an arena, standing still as the world screams.
    — CLIP: Ye’s “Sunday Service”—choir in white, Ye in shadows, hands up to heaven.
    — CLIP: Ye, tears streaming, ranting, praying.

                NARRATOR (V.O.)
        Ye is not a celebrity.  
        Ye is a weather system.

            (crescendo, mythic)

        Lightning, thunder, rumor, revelation.  
        Walking contradiction.  
        Truth-teller. Agitator.  
        Artist who refuses to die quietly.

            (final, darkly poetic)

        To love him is to risk the backlash.  
        To hate him is to admit you’re watching.

Ye stands alone, spotlight burning, mask on—already plotting his next reinvention.

HELL-MOUTH  
CHAPTER: YE CALLS HUNTER

INT. HUNTER’S APARTMENT – NIGHT

Rain on the windows—staccato, relentless.  
Hunter sits alone, shirtless, backlit by laptop light.

                ON SCREEN (TMZ FOOTAGE)
        “GAGA TO HUNTER HARDON: YOU’RE NOT A MONSTER — BUT YOU’RE CLOSE.”

His phone buzzes.

                PHONE SCREEN
        UNKNOWN CALLER.

A deep inhale. Hunter answers.

                HUNTER
        Who the fuck is this?

A beat of silence. Then—

                YE (V.O.)
        It’s Ye.

Hunter freezes. The call is a spell, freezing the world.

INSERT – FREEZE FRAME – BLACK VOID

The action stops. Voices echo in slow motion.  
A phone screen glows with “INCOMING CALL: YE.”  
The Narrator speaks.

                NARRATOR (V.O., breathless, awe-struck)
        Pause.  
        Understand what’s happening here.

        For Hunter, a phone call from Ye isn’t just gossip or fandom.  
        It’s not just a celebrity cameo.  
        It’s a signal from the center of the media spiral.

        When Ye calls, it’s like being summoned to Olympus—  
        Like Zeus hurling a lightning bolt straight to your battered brain.

        Ye is the code. The rupture.  
        The glitch in the American myth.  
        He is power, prophecy, controversy—  
        and in this world, *everybody* wants to be close to the power.

        To get a call from Ye means you’ve crossed over—  
        From spectator to participant.  
        From victim to variable.

            (closer, almost whispering)

        Ye’s voice in your ear means you matter.  
        You’re a threat, or a vessel.  
        Or a warning shot fired in 4/4 time.

            (beat)

        For Hunter? It’s not even about approval.  
        It’s about being witnessed by the only eyes  
        that really change the algorithm.

        That call?  
        It means the spiral just got a new center.

Unfreeze.  
The phone rings again—louder, cosmic.

                YE (V.O.)
        You gave her the phone call.  
        The crying, the spiral, the full human moment.  
        I want that too.

                HUNTER (defensive)
        You want me to cry on command?

                YE (V.O.)
        I want the *real* Hunter.  
        Not the spiral. Not the sex voice.  
        Not the degenerate in mascara.  
        The *man.*

                HUNTER (grinning)
        That version’s not very brand-safe.

                YE (V.O.)
        Neither am I.

A tense pause.  
Rain slashes the window; thunder rumbles.

                YE (V.O., CONT’D)
        You think you’re unpredictable.  
        You’re not.  
        I know your cadence before you say the line.  
        I *invented* that performance arc.

                HUNTER
        So what do you want? Forgiveness? Collaboration? A duet?

                YE (V.O.)
        I want the same deal Gaga got.  
        Fifteen minutes with the real you.  
        No press. No broadcast. No microphones.  
        Just us.  
        Black void. Black coffee. Black mirror shit.

        But I swear to God, if you show up with Artpop energy, I’m walking.

                HUNTER (laughs, hard)
        Oh, you mean unhinged glam broken doll reinventing her trauma in platform heels?

                YE (V.O.)
        Exactly.

                HUNTER (smirking)
        So… me.

                YE (V.O.)
        I want the *before*.  
        The boy under the spiral.  
        The one who thinks no one’s watching.

A pause—a vulnerability hangs in the air.

                HUNTER (soft)
        You sure you can handle that?

                YE (V.O.)
        I handled cancelation, paranoia, God, the White House, and Adidas.  
        I think I can handle *your gay little soul.*

A long silence.  
Hunter bites his lip.

                HUNTER
        Okay.

                YE (V.O.)
        Okay?

                HUNTER
        I’ll meet you in the black.  
        But only if you come without the armor.

                YE (V.O.)
        That’s the only way I ever come.

They hang up at the same time.

                                                CUT TO:

BLACK SCREEN.

                ON SCREEN TEXT
        “HUNTER HARDON VS. YE: PRIVATE TAPING, UNAUTHORIZED, UNRELEASED.”

STATIC.

---

INT. BLACK VOID – AUDIO VISUALIZER – TIMELESS

Total darkness.

A thin WHITE SOUNDWAVE LINE reacts to every voice, pause, tremble, and breath.  
When emotions surge, the wave distorts.  
When silence hits, it flattens.

The voices: YE and HUNTER HARDON.  
Unfiltered. Unscripted. Unseen.

                ON SCREEN TEXT (simple, stark)
        “LEAKED AUDIO: PRIVATE CONVERSATION BETWEEN HUNTER HARDON + YE”  
        “DURATION: 13:04 — UNAUTHORIZED, UNRELEASED”

SOUNDWAVE SPIKES:

                YE (V.O.)
        They think we’re insane.

                HUNTER (V.O.)
        Aren’t we?

                YE (V.O.)
        Not the way they mean.

            (pause)

        I didn’t come here to save you.

                HUNTER (V.O.)
        Good. That job’s already taken by shame and Adderall.

                YE (V.O.)
        I came because you said something true.  
        In the middle of the filth.  
        And truth in filth? That’s sacred.

The waveform ripples—soft static distortion.

                HUNTER (V.O.)
        You think I’m sacred?

                YE (V.O.)
        I think you’re dangerous.  
        But you *know* you're dangerous. That’s the difference.

                HUNTER (V.O.)
        And what are you?

                YE (V.O.)
        I’m the mirror you don’t want to look in.  
        I’m what happens when performance wins.

                HUNTER (V.O.)
        I saw the spiral in you before I saw it in me.

                YE (V.O.)
        And you built yours out of cum and glitter.

                HUNTER (V.O.)
        And you built yours out of scripture and capitalism.

                YE (V.O.)
        We both worshiped feedback.

                HUNTER (V.O.)
        We both became gods and asked to be punished.

Silence. The waveform flattens.

                YE (V.O.)
        Why’d you do it?

                HUNTER (V.O.)
        Which part?

                YE (V.O.)
        The post. The crime. The content. The spiral.

                HUNTER (V.O.)
        I wanted to feel something.  
        I wanted to be seen.  
        I didn’t stop to ask who I was hurting.  
        Because the pain was louder than the ethics.

                YE (V.O.)
        So you made your pain everyone else’s.

                HUNTER (V.O.)
        You’re one to talk.

                YE (V.O.)
        That’s why I’m here.

SOUNDWAVE SPIKES sharply—pain, tension.

                HUNTER (V.O.)
        Do you regret anything?

                YE (V.O.)
        I regret underestimating how hungry the world is  
        to crucify black noise.

            (beat)

        And I regret confusing attention with redemption.

                HUNTER (V.O.)
        Same.

                YE (V.O.)
        You’re still in the middle of it.

                HUNTER (V.O.)
        What if I never get out?

                YE (V.O.)
        Then die loud.  
        Or find a quieter god.

SOUNDWAVE DIPS—soft breathing between them.

                HUNTER (V.O.)
        I want to help people.  
        I want to make something beautiful out of something unforgivable.

                YE (V.O.)
        That’s not your choice.  
        That’s theirs.

            (beat)

        All you can do is tell the truth.  
        Even if it costs you the whole audience.

                HUNTER (V.O.)
        That’s easy for you to say.

                YE (V.O.)
        No it’s not.  
        That’s why I’m saying it here.

Silence. Waveform slowly pulses—heartbeat tempo.

                HUNTER (V.O.)
        Thank you for showing up.

                YE (V.O.)
        You’re welcome.  
        Just don’t mistake this for mercy.

                HUNTER (V.O.)
        What is it then?

                YE (V.O.)
        Reflection.  
        And reflection ain’t mercy. It’s consequence.

            (pause)

        When they come for you again—and they will—  
        remember who sat across from you in the dark  
        and didn’t blink.

                HUNTER (V.O.)
        I remember everything.  
        That’s the curse.

                YE (V.O.)
        Turn it into prophecy.  
        Or it’ll rot you.

Silence. Waveform flatlines. Then a final breath.

                                                FADE TO:

BLACK SCREEN.

                ON SCREEN TEXT
        “This conversation remains unaired.”  
        “But the spiral shifted that night.”

STATIC.

INT. HUNTER’S MIND – TMZ.COM – CONTINUOUS

The HUM of the old TV cuts.  
Replaced by silence.  
Then—

                CLICK.

A PHONE RING.  
Not digital.  
Analog. Ugly. Too real.

                HUNTER
        ...Hello?

                YE (V.O.)
        That’s how you answer?  
        You give Gaga a whole monologue  
        and I get a fucking whisper?

                HUNTER
        I didn’t know it was you.

                YE (V.O.)
        Nah.  
        You didn’t *hope* it was me.  
        But I’m here anyway.

                HUNTER
        I didn’t ask for this.

                YE (V.O.)
        Yeah you did.  
        Every time you hit record and called it a confession.  
        Every time you edited the breakdown  
        into something digestible.

            (beat)

        Gaga got the dream version.  
        I want the one that still stinks.

                HUNTER
        I’m tired.

                YE (V.O.)
        So say that.  
        Say you’re tired.  
        Say you’re scared.  
        Say you want to be good but it’s easier to be loud.

                HUNTER
        ...I want to be good.  
        But I don’t know who’s watching anymore.

                YE (V.O.)
        Everyone.  
        And no one.  
        That’s the curse.

A spotlight flickers on.  
YE sits in a folding chair across from Hunter—  
half-demon, half-man, glitching in and out of visibility.

                YE
        Let me ask you something:

            (leans in)

        If there were no audience—  
        would you still be broken?

                HUNTER
        I don’t know.

                YE
        Then you’re not ready to heal.  
        You’re just trying to win the narrative.

                HUNTER
        And what are *you* trying to do?

                YE
        Remind you that shame doesn’t make you interesting.  
        And neither does lying about it.

Beat.

                YE (CONT’D)
        Gaga lets you dream.  
        I’m here so you remember who the fuck you are  
        when the dream ends.

The VOID pulses.  
Hunter looks down.  
His hands are shaking.

                HUNTER
        So what now?

                YE
        You take the mic.  
        And this time—  
        you don’t sing.

            (beat)

        You speak.

Ye vanishes.  
The spotlight remains.

Hunter alone again.  
But different.

A MICROPHONE lowers from the dark above.  
Old-school. Heavy. Real.

Hunter looks at it.  
Then up.  
Then...

                                                CUT TO BLACK.
