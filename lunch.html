INSERT SCENE – LUNCH WITH THE NARRATOR

INT. LIMINAL DINING ROOM – TIME UNRAVELS POLITELY

A table for two.  
Silver so polished it gaslights the eye.  
Ghostlight pours in from nowhere.

THE NARRATOR sits across from YOU.  
Yes — you.  
Don’t look around.  
You’ve been summoned. You cannot leave until dessert.

A SINGLE GLASS CLOCHE covers the plate before him.  
Steam curls like a whispered insult.

                        NARRATOR (V.O.)
            Shall we?

He lifts the lid.

REVEAL:

— Sous-vide chicken breast, cut precisely into five coins  
— Glazed with a mirror-shine reduction of bone marrow and regret  
— Nested atop a saffron risotto so yellow it screams  
— Dotted with blood orange gel and shaved truffle from a war zone  
— Served on black ceramic hand-fired in the ruins of a failed marriage

He slices the first coin like surgery.  
Chews with reverence. A moan, nearly imperceptible.

                        NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
            You can tell a man’s worth  
            by how he seasons his breakdown.

                        (beat)
            Bon appétit.

YOU HAVE NO PLATE.  
You are here to witness, not consume.
