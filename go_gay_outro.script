HELL-MOUTH  
FINAL OUTRO: “GO GAY” (UNCENSORED CUT)

INT. RADIO STUDIO – NIGHT

Hunter Hardon sprawls at the mic, sleeves shoved up, collar open, sweat glistening on his chest.

The “ON AIR” sign throbs overhead—red, hungry, unblinking.

He leans in—mouth almost kissing the microphone, gaze drunk with exhaustion and electricity.

            HUNTER  
    (into mic, voice raspy)
    All right, freaks.  
    Before I vanish into the WiFi and the shame cycle,  
    let me hit you with something messy. Something true.

He takes a long, hard breath. It shudders.

            HUNTER  
    (confessional, dirty)
    Get the fuck out of your straight relationship.  
    I’m serious.  
    Break up with your vanilla boyfriend.  
    Walk out on your boring-ass girlfriend.  
    File for divorce if you’re married to safety.

    (beat)

    Life’s too fucking short to die curious.

He grins, tongue flicking over his lips. He is both preacher and slut.

            HUNTER  
    (building, daring)
    Stop pretending you’re not looking.  
    Stop pretending you haven’t thought about it.  
    Suck a dick if you’re a man—once, twice, every night until you moan someone else’s name.  
    Eat pussy like it’s a sacrament.  
    Fuck a friend. Fuck a stranger. Fuck yourself in the mirror until the shame turns holy.

He laughs, almost gasping, head thrown back. No more performance—just raw hunger.

            HUNTER  
    (wild, sexy, honest)
    Don’t “experiment.” Don’t “wonder.”  
    Get naked with the future.  
    Let someone kiss the part of you you hide.  
    Let the sweat drip down your back. Let the guilt dissolve in spit and static.

    (leaning in, voice nearly trembling)
    Don’t settle for boring. Don’t settle for safe.  
    Go get corrupted. Go make mistakes you’ll jerk off to for years.

    (lowers voice, filthy, vulnerable)
    Go gay.  
    Go gay like it’s a fucking crime.  
    Go gay like the world is ending and this is your last night alive.  
    Go gay because it will save your fucking life.  
    Or at least make it worth filming.

A crooked, dangerous smile.

            HUNTER  
    (whispering)
    Taste something forbidden.  
    Get on your knees for a new religion.  
    Find God between someone’s thighs.  
    Fuck until you forget your name and remember your body.

    (voice cracks, soft now)
    Or don’t.  
    Stay straight. Stay numb.  
    But don’t call it living.

He wipes his mouth. Eyes bright, body shaking, no shame left.

            HUNTER  
    (final, naked honesty)
    Life is hell.  
    Joy is a riot.  
    Tonight, go out there and ruin yourself for anyone who ever told you “no.”  
    This is your invitation. This is your dare.

He winks, obscene and luminous.

            HUNTER  
    (grinning, urgent)
    Go gay.  
    Go all the way.  
    Fuck shame.  
    Risk everything for a stupid, beautiful, useless moment of truth.

He blows a dirty kiss to the camera.  
The “ON AIR” light blinks out.

— Silence.  
— A faint, ghostly echo: Hunter’s laughter, Hunter’s gasp, all of it looping into static.

    “…Risk everything for joy…”
    “…Taste something forbidden…”
    “…Go gay like the world is ending…”

FADE TO BLACK.

INSERT – THE VIEWER

A FACE IN THE DARKNESS — genderless, gorgeous, terrified.

Eyes wide. Lips parted. Breath held.

Hunter’s voice licks through the screen like smoke, like heat, like truth too long denied.

The viewer trembles.  
A SHIVER starts at the base of their spine.

            HUNTER (V.O.)  
    Let someone kiss the part of you you hide...

The viewer’s pupils dilate.

Fingers twitch. Knees press together. Then open.

Something breaks—  
Not loud.  
More like the snap of a zipper, or a secret whispered in church.

A gasp.

Their mouth forms the words before they know they’ve said them:

            THE VIEWER  
    Oh my God.  
    I think I’m gonna go gay.

            (beat)

    I think I want to.

            (beat)

    I think I already am.

A soft, stunned laugh escapes.  
They touch their lips like they’ve just kissed someone holy.

The screen pulses. Hunter’s voice returns.

            HUNTER (V.O.)  
    Go gay like it will save your life.

FLASH — the viewer’s past lovers. Their shame. Their silence.  
FLASH — the body they never touched. The kiss they never dared.  
FLASH — the door, finally, swinging open.

BACK TO SCENE.

END OF OUTRO SEQUENCE.
