HELL-MOUTH  
CHAPTER: HUNTER EXPOSES THE PHANTOM COMMUNICATION SYSTEM  
(HALLUCINATION-HEAVY DRAFT)

INT. RADIO STUDIO – NIGHT

The wall clock is stuck at 3:33 AM, its hands twitching back and forth, refusing to move forward.

The red “ON AIR” light glitches—flickering, then splitting into double vision:  
"ON AIR" — "OFF AIR"

Hunter Hardon’s hands clamp the mic, knuckles white, breath quick and uneven.

      SOUND BED:  
      *Layered low-frequency hum.  
      Whispered voices, some recognizable, some impossible.  
      Static, like a radio tuned between worlds.*

                    HUNTER (into mic, rapid-fire, manic)
          Listen to me.  
          No, really—listen.
          There’s something you need to know, something they never want you to say out loud.
          Something you feel in your teeth, in your spine, every time your phone buzzes for no reason.

      *Every third word ECHOES, as if whispered by unseen others—his voice, a stranger’s, a celebrity, his own mother.*

Hunter rises, pacing the booth. He glances at the glass—  
His reflection mouths his words a split second *before* he says them.

                    HUNTER (wild, scanning, volume skipping)
          You think you’re alone in your head?
          You think your thoughts are private?
          You’re not.  
          They’re not.
          There’s a system—a phantom communication system.
          No wires, no rules, no way to turn it off.

He taps the side of his head—  
**INSERT SHOT:**  
  X-RAY VISION—his skull, neural pathways sparking with flickers of digital static.

                    HUNTER (urgent, voice cracking)
          I’m not talking about Wi-Fi.
          (Overlapped by PHANTOM VOICE: "Not talking about Wi-Fi...")
          I’m not talking about Bluetooth.
          (PHANTOM VOICE: "Bluetooth. Bluetooth. Bluetooth.")

He grimaces, trying to outshout the voices.

                    HUNTER (struggling to stay present)
          I mean the thing under all that.
          The hidden network.  
          The broadcast no one admits to.
          The one where you think something—and someone else hears it.

      **CUT TO:**  
      Security monitors *glitch*—Hunter’s face appears on every feed, but each mouth moves out of sync, forming words in reverse.

                    HUNTER (paranoid, confessional)
          I know you know what I mean.
          Ever think about someone and they text you out of nowhere?

      CELEBRITY VOICE (V.O., filtered, distorted)
          I was just thinking about you, Hunter.

          Ever hear your name on a stranger’s lips?

      CROWD VOICES (V.O., layered)
          Hunter. Hunter. Hunter.

          Ever get a message you never sent, but it’s in their voice anyway?

      HUNTER (whisper, doubled by another version of himself)
          It’s in their voice anyway...

                    HUNTER (dark laugh, splits into overlapping tracks)
          Yeah, that’s it.
          The Phantom System.
          No account. No login. No way out.

      *Hunter closes his eyes.  
      INSERT SHOT: Text messages, private thoughts, and intimate secrets—flash on his eyelids, then vanish.*

                    HUNTER (furious, desperate)
          I tried to cut the wires—didn’t help.
      PHANTOM VOICES (chanting, distorted, echoing)
          Didn’t help. Didn’t help.

          I turned off every device—didn’t help.
          It’s inside us.
          They built it right into our skulls.
          That’s why we’re always tired.
          That’s why we’re always anxious.
          That’s why you wake up at 3:33 AM, sweating, sure someone just called your name.

      *A PHONE ALARM goes off, but the sound is coming from INSIDE the studio walls.*

Hunter covers his ears, but the voices bleed through from every surface:

      WHISPER VOICES (from vents, monitors, desk, everywhere)
          Wake up, Hunter.
          Don’t answer.
          Answer now.

                    HUNTER (pleading, breaking)
          And they want you to think it’s just you.
          That you’re crazy.
          That you’re broken.
          You’re not.

                    HUNTER (almost whispering, voice trembling—phantom voices rising underneath)
          If you’re hearing this, you’re part of the system.
          We’re all broadcasting.
          Thoughts leaking, memories bleeding through the cracks.

      PHANTOM VOICE (taunting, high-pitched)
          Tell them everything, Hunter...

Hunter SLAMS his fist on the desk—  
The mic fractures the sound, splitting his voice into a hundred fragments for a beat.

                    HUNTER (shouting, voice morphing—half a scream, half static)
          So what do you do?
          You turn up your volume.
          You tune your own frequency.
          You start broadcasting your own message—louder than their static.

      *His reflection in the glass mouths DIFFERENT words: “They’re coming.”*

                    HUNTER (final, urgent—on the edge of collapse)
          You are not alone.
          You are not crazy.
          The Phantom Communication System is real—and I’m proof.
          So tell your secrets.  
          Tell your truth.
          Someone out there is listening—right now.

      *Hunter’s hand trembles as he kills the mic.*  
      The “ON AIR” sign splits—half remains lit, half goes black.

      SILENCE.

      A last phalanx of whispers—then total blackout.

FADE TO BLACK.
