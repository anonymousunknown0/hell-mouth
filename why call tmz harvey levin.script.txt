INT. BLACK VOID – FROZEN MOMENT – TIMELESS

The audio **freezes** on Hunter’s voice:  
Did you hear me… I’m scared… I think I might need a lawyer…

Silence.  
The screen seems to shiver, then holds perfectly still.

                NARRATOR (V.O., analytical, sharp)
        Why Harvey Levin?

        (beat)

        Why call *him*—of all people—when the world is burning down around you?

        (quiet, mulling it over)

        Hunter’s already told you.  
        He said it himself—“Did you hear me? I’m scared. I think I might need a lawyer.”

        (leans in, dissecting the words)

        Who do you call when your shame goes viral?  
        When your private breakdown becomes public property?

        You call the man who built a kingdom on other people’s worst days.

        Harvey isn’t just a lawyer.  
        He’s a judge, a gatekeeper, the sultan of second chances—  
        and the executioner for everyone who runs out of luck.

        (slowly, with the weight of history)

        Hunter worked for TMZ’s general manager and executive producer for five years.  
        He learned the choreography of scandal from the inside out.

        He knows that a single call with Harvey can end you, save you, or—worst of all—  
        keep you hanging, waiting for the verdict.

        (softer, compassionate now)

        So why Harvey?  
        Because deep down, every fallen star wants to plead their case to the person who *knows*  
        what it’s like to play God for a living.

        Because when you’re scared,  
        when you’re cornered by the truth and the headlines,  
        you want someone ruthless enough to understand it—  
        and, just maybe,  
        someone powerful enough to forgive you.

        (final, fading)

        That’s why you call Harvey Levin.

The call unfreezes.  
Hunter’s voice returns—  
a little smaller, a little more exposed.
