HELL-MOUTH  
INSERT – THE PUBLICIST’S SCANDAL ROLL CALL

INT. BLACK VOID – HUNTER’S HEADSPACE – TIMELESS

A glowing white waveform crackles in darkness.  
Hunter’s silhouette sits on a stool, clutching his phone.

A sharp inhale.  
The Publicist’s voice slices through.

                            PUBLICIST (V.O.)
                Okay, rapid fire, no spin—  
                Here’s what’s burning, and you need to listen.

Each “scandal” is delivered as a jarring, overdriven *BEEP*  
— the content forever redacted, the anxiety unmistakable.

                            PUBLICIST (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                *BEEP* — The hotel elevator.
                *BEEP* — The [REDACTED] DMs from April.
                *BEEP* — That audio leak, the one with the—
                *BEEP* — The New Year’s livestream incident.
                *BEEP* — The deepfake that keeps resurfacing.
                *BEEP* — Your ex’s podcast “exclusive.”
                *BEEP* — That burner account, which is not as secret as you think.
                *BEEP* — The medical file “accident.”
                *BEEP* — That thing with the wax statue in Paris.
                *BEEP* — The party footage TMZ still wants.

Hunter winces at every *BEEP*.  
The waveform spikes, then settles into a throb of dread.

                            PUBLICIST (V.O.)
                Some of these are containable.
                Some will need a miracle or a memory wipe.
                All of them are ticking.

                (deadly calm)

                Don’t post. Don’t reply.  
                Let me do my job.

                            HUNTER
                (shaken)
                Is that all?

A pause.  
Then one last, piercing *BEEP*.

                            PUBLICIST (V.O.)
                Not even close.
                I’ll call you when I’ve put out the fires—  
                or when you’re trending again.

Hunter, silent, stares into the dark—  
Each *BEEP* echoing, the price of every secret kept.

CUT BACK TO:  
THE VOID.
