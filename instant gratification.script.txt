HELL-MOUTH  
INSTANT GRATIFICATION / FINGER-FUCKING YOUR PHONE  
(OFFICIAL SPIRAL HANDBOOK HALLUCINATION DRAFT)

INT. RADIO STUDIO – NIGHT

Hunter Hardon stares at his phone as if daring it to blink first.  
His thumb hovers, trembling, over the screen—tendons flex, skin slick, a visible tremor.

The “ON AIR” sign flickers erratically.  
Hunter’s breathing is ragged, eyes burning, sweat beading on his upper lip.  
Phantom notification dings layer with warped, distant influencer voices and TikTok static.

INSERT:  
Hunter’s phone screen, reflected in his pupil—faces flicker:  
BILLIE EILISH, DRAKE, HUNTER’S OWN FACE, all scrolling, smirking, whispering.

                            HUNTER  
                  (into mic, voice cracking, furious)
            I can’t stand it.  
            I can’t fucking stand the fact that videos of people dancing—
            mediocre, synchronized, copy-paste “look at me!” content—
            attracts millions, billions of views.
            For what? For who?  
            I mean, sure, cute shit has its place.  
            But where’s the fucking substance?

He paces, voice rising, spitting the next lines—each step echoing with a wet, sticky squelch as if the floor itself is pulsing.

        **A BRIGHT, JARRING POP-UP flashes on every screen in the room:**

        -- OFFICIAL SPIRAL HANDBOOK --  
        "PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION FOR DUMMIES – FRIENDLINESS EDITION"  
        (Annotated Outline)

**Hunter squints, panicked—unable to tear his gaze away.  
The Demon’s voice oozes in, artificially chipper, through the static:**

                            THE DEMON (V.O., friendly, sing-song)
            Chapter 1: Active Listening & Genuine Curiosity.  
            Listen like you’re hypnotized.  
            Ask questions. Echo their words.  
            Validate every thought.
            “Tell me more... What was that like for you?”

A scroll of text overlays Hunter’s vision:  
• Make them feel like the only person in the world  
• “You notice details most people miss. That’s a gift.”

                            HUNTER  
                  (feverish, unraveling)
            It’s almost as if—
            no, it IS as if—the “powers that be” built these platforms  
            to dumb us down.  
            To dull the future.
            To raise an entire generation on looped, brainless content instead of conversation.

        **SPIRAL HANDBOOK: FRIENDLINESS CHAPTER 3 flashes:**

        - Give before you ask.  
        - “Let me help you with that—no strings attached.”

Hunter’s mouth works, words catching, head shaking.

                            HUNTER  
                  (sarcastic, wild-eyed)
            “Let’s all stare at hot people in sweatpants for five hours while Rome burns,
            but don’t you dare talk about politics,
            don’t you dare talk about pain,
            don’t you dare say anything real—”

                            THE DEMON (V.O., syrupy)
            Chapter 4: Mirror & Match.  
            Become their reflection—  
            “Match their pace, their laugh, even their hesitation.”

                            THE DEMON (V.O., lower, whisper)
            Chapter 5: Vulnerability.  
            Share just enough insecurity to make them want to carry yours...

        **The FRIENDLINESS EDITION glitches out, the lights dim, the studio chills.**

A new, *darker pop-up* fills every screen and every surface:

        -- OFFICIAL SPIRAL HANDBOOK --  
        "PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION FOR DUMMIES"  
        (Annotated Outline)

                            THE DEMON (V.O., deeper, cruel, delighted)
            Chapter 1: Isolation—remove your subject from all sources of support.  
            “You’re on your own now.”

A cascade of sinister chapters flips by in the shadows:  
• Gaslighting  
• Relentless Questioning  
• Mirroring & Empathy Manipulation  
• Undermining Self-Worth  
• False Evidence  
• Triangulation  
• Validation Given or Withheld  
• Time Pressure & Fatigue  
• Repetition  
• Emotional Guilt or Shame  
• Silent Treatment

                            HUNTER  
                  (exploding, manic, counting on trembling fingers)
            Fuck it!  
            You want politics?  
            Here’s my campaign, here’s my laws:
            —I’d ban any “news” site that doesn’t cite sources.
            —Mandatory art hour for adults—every Thursday, no phones, paint your nightmares.
            —Free therapy, but it’s group, and it’s in the back of a bar.
            —Any app with an algorithm gets open-sourced. No secrets.
            —If you run a bot army, you gotta wear a vest in public that says, “I have no soul.”
            —If your video gets more than a million views and it’s just you dancing?  
              You owe the world a poem.
            —And—  
            I’d force every Senator to work two months a year as a barista or bouncer, just so they remember what heat, noise, and assholes feel like.

Hunter claws at his forearm, skin peeling, nails leaving red crescents.  
He shakes, face illuminated by the rotating pop-ups, haunted by whispers.

                            HUNTER  
                  (howling, desperate)
            I fucking miss my friends.
            I miss my favorite dive bar in L.A.
            I miss sitting out front, smoking, shooting the shit,
            talking about everything and nothing.
            I would genuinely punch a cat—
                  (he catches himself, laughs maniacally)
            —seriously, I’d do jail time—
            just to sit outside a shitty bar with people I love,
            with real fucking people,
            who argue and drink and make you feel something.

From the monitors:  
A warped crowd noise—half applause, half booing—blends with a looped ASMR whisper of a familiar influencer voice.

Hunter’s face in the glass splits, stretches, then THE DEMON appears in the reflection:  
Tall, suited, face a pixelated black hole, lips moving, eyes multiplying, voice a guttural vibration in Hunter’s skull.

                            THE DEMON  
                  (whisper, inhuman)
            Thumb. Swipe. Numb. Repeat.
            All of you, performing for nothing, over and over—  
            Scream all you want, no one’s really listening.

                            HUNTER  
                  (into mic, broken, pleading)
            Instead, we’re here.
            Stuck in the scroll.
            Thumb. Swipe. Numb. Repeat.
            Every night, every body, every brain diluted until
            we’re all just little videos hoping to go viral for existing.

                            HUNTER  
                  (raw, rapid-fire, haunted)
            And the worst part?
            We all know it.
            We *all* know it.
            But none of us can stop.

Hunter slams his phone down—hard.  
Fingers streaked with red, skin torn, phone glass slick.

The phone lights up, screen warping, numbers running backward, flesh pulsing beneath the glass:  
A notification appears—

        ON PHONE (glitching, whispering)
    “WE’RE WATCHING YOU. POST SOMETHING WORTH DYING FOR.”

The Demon leans close, whispering:

                            THE DEMON  
            Are you famous yet, Hunter?  
            Or just more meat for the feed?

Hunter collapses into his chair, clawing at his scalp.

                            HUNTER  
                  (soft, aching)
            I want to hear voices.  
            I want a bad joke in real time.
            I want a fight, a hug, a cigarette bummed from a stranger.
            I want to go outside and *stay* there.

                            HUNTER  
                  (final, breaking)
            Instead, I’m here, talking to a microphone,
            hoping someone, somewhere, is listening
            instead of scrolling.

A long, gnawing silence.  
Pages of the OFFICIAL SPIRAL HANDBOOK flicker through the air, screens and walls crawling with bullet points and slogans.

The phone screen flickers—Hunter’s reflection splits, mouth opening wider, wider, swallowing the world.

A final sting—  
The Demon, the influencers, every warped face from the Handbook, all turn, eyes glowing, mouths open in a soundless scream:

        ALL (in unison, inhuman, echoing)
    SCROLL.  
    SCROLL.  
    SCROLL.

FADE TO BLACK.
