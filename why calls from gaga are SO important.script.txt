INSERT – FREEZE FRAME – BLACK VOID (GAGA CALL + GLORIFYING MONTAGE)

INT. BLACK VOID – TIMELESS

Hunter’s phone glows.
ON SCREEN: “INCOMING CALL: LADY GAGA.”
Everything around Hunter blurs except the phone, lit up like a relic.

                    NARRATOR (V.O.)
          Stop.
          This isn’t just another hallucination.
          This is the mother tongue of modern myth.

          A phone call from Gaga is not a call from a pop star.
          It’s a summons from the high priestess of reinvention.
          The architect of shame, spectacle, and survival.

          Gaga is more than a celebrity—she’s the oracle in the dress of the day.
          She’s the last true saint of the televised soul.

          (CUT TO VIDEO MONTAGE – GAGA ASCENDS)
          — MET GALA (CAMP): Gaga strips off layers—pink cape, black dress, sequined bra—posing, winking, turning the red carpet into a confessional.
          — CONCERT FILM: Gaga at the piano, belting “Shallow,” voice trembling, crowd sobbing, rainbow spotlights spinning.
          — PAPARAZZI FOOTAGE: Gaga emerging from a limo, sunglasses diamond-bright, throwing a peace sign, chaos of cameras.
          — BACKSTAGE: Gaga kissing a queer fan’s hand, leaving a lipstick mark, mouthing “You’re a superstar.”
          — HEADLINE FEED: “GAGA HEALS THE MONSTERS,” “GAGA SAYS: ‘TURN PAIN INTO POP.’”

                    NARRATOR (V.O., closer, whispering)
          For Hunter, Gaga is permission incarnate.
          Gaga says: Survive, but make it look like a music video.
          She’s the first voice that told him:
                Yes, your scars are real.
                Yes, your hunger is holy.
                Yes, you’re allowed to turn breakdowns into broadcasts.

          (MONTAGE CONTINUES)
          — “BAD ROMANCE” music video: Gaga spinning, lightning in her eyes, monsters behind her, claws out.
          — SUPER BOWL: She leaps, she falls, she rises. Fireworks, glitter, confetti rain.
          — GAGA AS JOANNE: Soft pink hat, tears, quiet piano.
          — GAGA AS STARMAN: Alien chrome, glitching screens, “born this way.”

                    NARRATOR (V.O., feverish, poetic)
          When Gaga calls, she is the only mother who understands how to raise a monster and make it art.
          Her voice is the balm for shame—
          The one voice that never asked him to be smaller, quieter, easier to brand.

          A phone call from Gaga means the curtain drops and the real show begins.
          It means someone out there understands—
          Not just the pain, but the performance.
          Not just the wound, but the remix.

          For everyone else, Gaga is a headline.
          For Hunter, she’s a lifeline—
          The difference between being seen as a warning or a miracle.

          When Gaga calls, the universe changes its lighting cue.

The montage ends with Gaga blowing a kiss, surrounded by strobes and paparazzi flashes—her eyes fixed right at the lens.

Unfreeze. The ringtone is an aria. Hunter answers.
